        <h2>What is Your Home Network?</h2>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Think of your home network as the backbone of your smart home. Its the invisible web that connects all your device, like your smart lights, thermostat, and security cameras, allowing them to communicate with each other. Most of these devices connect to your network through a router, which is that box with antennas that your Internet Service Provider (ISP) likely gave you. Your router connects to the internet via a cable that comes from outside your home.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Many people mistakenly refer to their home network as “Wi-Fi.” While Wi-Fi is the wireless technology that allows devices to connect to your network, we will use “home network” in this guide to keep things clear.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">How Does Your Home Network Affect Smart Home Security?</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A poorly set up home network can be an open door for hackers. If you have a weak password or havent changed the default password on your router or smart devices, youre making it easy for someone to sneak in.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Many people dont bother changing the default admin password for their router. This is the password you use to access the routers settings. If its still the default, it might be publicly available online, making it a hackers dream. Change it now!!</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The same goes for your Wi-Fi password, the one you use to connect your devices like phones, laptops, and TVs.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">What About Hardcoded Passwords?</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Sometimes, the admin or Wi-Fi passwords on your router are hardcoded, meaning they cant be changed. If thats the case, its best to replace that router with one that allows you to set your own passwords.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">Vulnerabilities in Your Smart Devices</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Some smart devices come with insecure network settings right out of the box. If you dont change these settings, hackers could exploit them to gain access to your home network.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h2 >Securing Your Smart Home Network</h2>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Now that you understand the risks, lets dive into how to secure your home network for your smart devices.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">1.  Change Default Passwords</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">First things first: change any default Wi-Fi or router admin passwords to strong, unique passwords. If your device has a hardcoded password, consider replacing it with a more secure option.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">2.  Configure Your Firewall</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Your firewall acts like a security guard for your network, allowing only approved traffic in. Make sure its set up to only allow the traffic necessary for your smart devices to function.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If youre unsure how to configure your firewall, search online for guides specific to your router model. YouTube is a great resource for visual learners!</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">3.  Close Unnecessary Ports</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Routers have various ports that allow different types of traffic to flow in and out. Some of these ports may be open by default, which can create vulnerabilities. Closing unnecessary ports is a crucial step in securing your network.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4>How to Close Ports:</h4>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li><strong>1. Log into Your Router:</strong> Open a web browser and enter your routers IP address (usually something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1). Enter your admin username and password. </li>
            <li><strong>2. Find the Port Forwarding Section:</strong> Look for a section labeled “Port Forwarding,” “Port Management,” or something similar. This is where you can see which ports are currently open.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Identify Unused Ports:</strong> Review the list of open ports. If you see ports that you dont use or recognise, its a good idea to close them. Common ports to close include those used for services you dont need, like FTP (port 21) or Telnet (port 23).</li>
            <li><strong>4. Close the ports:</strong> Follow the instructions in your routers interface to close the unnecessary ports. This usually involves selecting the port and choosing an option to disable or delete it.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Save Your Changes:</strong> Dont forget to save your changes before exiting the router settings.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">4.  Add a VPN to Your Router</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers to snoop on your data. You can install a VPN on your router, which will protect all devices connected to your network, including those that dont support VPNs themselves.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Again, check online for tutorials specific to your router model to help you through the installation process.</p>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">5.  Restrict Internet Access for Smart Devices</h4>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">This might sound extreme, but limiting internet access for your smart devices can significantly reduce your risk. The less data your devices transmit, the less chance there is for hackers to exploit them.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h4 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">6.  Set up VLANs</h4>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Think of a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) as seperating your home network into rooms, with different rules for each room. Heres a smart way to organise your devices:</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <ul style="font-size: 20px;">
            <li><strong>1. VLAN1:</strong> Devices that dont need internet access (like smart light switches and cameras). This VLAN keeps them isolated from potential threats.</li>
            <li><strong>2. VLAN2:</strong> Devices that do need internet access (like smart speakers). This VLAN can be set up to run through the VPN for added security. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Setting up VLANs will vary by router, but you can usually find instructions by logging into your routers admin page and navigating through the menus.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h2 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: bold;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Securing your smart home network may seem daunting, but taking these steps will significantly enhance your security and privacy. By changing default passwords, configuring your firewall, closing unnecessary ports, adding a VPN, and using VLANs, you can create a safer environment for your smart devices. Remember, a little effort goes a long way in protecting your home!</p>
