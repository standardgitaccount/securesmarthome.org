        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">What is meant by your home network?</h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">In terms of your smart home, the network is simply describing all your devices connected together and communicating with each other. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">They are typically connected using your router, the white/black box with arials, probably given to you by your ISP (Internet Service Provider, Sky or Virgin Media being two examples). Routers are connected to the internet using a copper/fibre cable, which is fed in from the outside of your home. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Some people may refer to their home network as their “wifi”. However, as wifi is the way devices (including smart home devices) connects to your network wirelessly, their “wifi” will be referred to as the home network in this guide, to avoid any confusion. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">Now that is cleared up..how does my home network affect my smart homes security?</h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Simply put, a poorly set up smart home network can allow hackers easy access to your smart home devices. A weak password or the default password on the back of your router/smart home device may allow hackers to easily join your home network. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Many people do not change their default router admin passwords, this is the password needed to access the important settings on the router itself. If left as the default password (the password assigned to it by the manufacturer), there is a chance that it is publically avaliable online, therefore hackers can view these, it is HIGHLY recommended that this is changed immediately. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The same applies for peoples wifi passwords, the password you need to use to connect your phone, laptop, TV etc to your home network wirelessly.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There is also the possibilty that the admin or wifi passwords on your router could be hardcoded, although this is more likely to be the admin password and not the wifi one.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Read more about passwords and smart homes here.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A feature on the router that is not set to the correct settings may also leave your home network vulnerable. A hacker potentially scanning your home network (yes, this does happen)  may be able to detect and exploit this, and could gain access to your network settings without needing a login. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There has also been instances where some smart home devices have been shipped with insecure network services (basically sets of rules that tell how the device how to communicate with other devices on your network). If settings on these devices are not changed to disable these insecure network services, these too could be a way a hacker could exploit your smart home. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">So, what can i do so that my network enables a secure smart home?</h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">As smart home devices focus so little on security and privacy, some the actions suggested in this guide may seem a little drastic. However, the actions are necessary to maintain security and privacy in your smart home. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Starting off, any default wifi or router admin passwords MUST be changed to a strong password. If the password is hardcoded into the device, the best advice would be to stop using it in your network, and replace it with a device that does not use hardcoded passwords at all. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Whilst ISP provided routers are generally not the best, they are often built to a cost so they can be provided for free with broadband packages, with a few tweaks they are good enough for a secure smart home.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Ideally, a decent off the shelf router will always be better as they have more features and provide better performance. In a simple home set up, you can pair an off the shelf router with your ISP router in modem mode (this is a setting where your ISP provided router acts almost like a pass-through for your internet connection, no device connects to it), with maybe some wifi range extenders chucked in there if your home is large. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">However, this solution can be expensive. So, this guide will cover solutions that can be applied across both instances. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Things that should always be configured correctly include the firewall. As the name suggests, this acts almost like a wall around your network, and only allows certain traffic (information from the internet/another device, approved by the firewall) to enter the network. This will differ slightly depending on what you use the internet for, but to ensure maximum security for your smart home, only traffic required to make the smart home device work should be allowed through the firewall. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If you are unsure on how to set up/configure a firewall, look up the make and model name of your router, and there will almost certainly be YouTube videos/online guides which will walk you through the process. For most routers, it is a case of logging into the admin page and using the correct menus.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Another good practice to ensure your smart home is secure is to add a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to your router. Whilst some may know that you can add a VPN to a computer, phone or tablet, people may not be aware that you can also add VPNs to your router.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph"> With a VPN, you effectively build a tunnel around yourself around yourself when you use the internet, allowing you to use the internet more securely whilst without being tracked. The advantage of doing this for a smart home is that it allows all devices on the network to use a VPN connection.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Most smart home devices do not offer the functionality of installing a VPN, so a VPN on your router will ensure that every smart home device on your network has extra bit of protection when connected to your network. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The process of adding a VPN to your router will differ depending on the make/model, but there should be YouTube videos/online tutorials that walk you through the process. For most routers, it is a case of logging into the admin page, and using the correct menus. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Talk about as little internet access as possible</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Talk about closing unecessary ports.</p>
