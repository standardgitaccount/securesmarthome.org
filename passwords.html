        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">Yawn..another lecture on why my password is bad..</h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Before you click away, consider this. Weak passwords are a main reason why peoples smart homes are hacked, it is therefore very important to know what makes a strong password. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">OWASP (The Open Worldwide Application Security project) released a top 10 list of reasons why Smart Homes are vulnerable, and Johnston. N (2018) stated in their online presentation stated that weak, guessable or hardcoded (unchangable) passwords are a reason why smart home devices are vulnerable. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There are also websites out there (such as defpass.com) that allow you to look up the model names of some smart home devices (and other equipment such as your router) and you can view the default password the manufacturer assigns to them. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There are also plenty of websites that list the most common passwords used, making bruteforcing (a technique where a hacker will use trial and error techniques to gain access) easier for hackers to do.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If your password is listed on either one of these types of sites, your password is publicly avaliable to hackers!! A BIG security risk which will make a hackers life very easy and the password must be changed immediately. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A 2014 report published by mashable.com found that 73,000 webcams were exposed to the internet, simply because people had not changed their passwords.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If your smart home device or router comes with a default password, the first thing you MUST do once getting it out of the box is to change that default password to a strong password. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">So, what can I do to ensure my password wont allow my smart home to be hacked?</h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Obviously, the answer is to use a strong password. But what is meant by a strong password? Lets break it down. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Now, a password must not contain your name, any part of it. Thinking about this logically makes sense, as someone bruteforcing your smart home will more than likely try your name quite early on in the hacking attempt. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Whilst this may seem obvious, there are still people out there who think a password with their name in it is acceptable, when it really isnt. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">It is advised by many cyber-security professionals to not include anything in your password that can be socially engineered (the act of manipulating someone to get sensitive info from them). This could include things like the town you grew up in, your spouses name, your favourite food/drink etc. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A password that contains letters, numbers and symbols (such as ! or @) in a random order are much harder to crack. However, the password must be a decent length (20 characters or longer) otherwise it will not take too long for a hacker to crack. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If a password has the above mentioned features, it will take a very long time (literal centuries if it is very long and contains lots of random letters, numbers and symbols) to crack. Therefore, hackers will not have the time or computing power to crack your password. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h3 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: underline;">But I dont want to make my password "too strong"..as I will forget it.. </h3>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There is no such thing as a password that is “too strong”. Whilst many people are afraid to change their passwords to one containing all of the above mentioned features, as they fear forgetting it and being locked out of their device/account, there are solutions to this problem.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The solution here is NOT to write these passwords down on a post-it note and stick it somewhere. Whilst this is just asking to lose the post-it note and therefore forget the password, it rather defeats the object of having a secure password as it is just there for anyone who walks past where the post-it is stuck to see. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph"> The same logic applies to writing passwords down in a notebook. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The best solution is to use a password manager. These provide one place for you to store all your passwords. Password managers are also usually encrypted (scrambling the content of your passwords up so it is unreadable, and you hold a key to put it back in order, usually by inputting a password) meaning your password is not there for everyone to see. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If you want a password manager that is easy to use and minimal hassle, Google and LastPass offer such solutions. LastPass do have a subscription service, but Googles basic password manager is free to use providing you have a Google account. Most password managers can even generate secure passwords for you and automatically input them. </p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If you want a password manager that doesnt require internet and allows finer control, other password managers such as KeePass exist. In the case of KeePass, it too is free to use and no account is required. </p>
