        <h2 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: bold;">Smart homes are popular</h2>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Smart home devices certainly are a great addition to your life, they can make small tasks effortless and convenient.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">They can serve as alarm clocks, radio/music streamers, thermostats and add features to appliances such as fridges. As well as this, smart home devices are often viewed as an always-there assistant.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Smart homes have become very popular, according to Raju, R and Moh, M (2022) in the paper “Cyber Security in smart homes”, the last decade saw the point where internet capable devices surpassed the human population!</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">According to vxchnge.com, 30% of US homes now have either an Alexa or Google Nest smart speaker in them. Making these kind of devices a great target for hackers.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <h2 class="text-left" style="text-decoration: bold;">The security problem</h2>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The rise of smart homes (particularly devices like the Amazon Alexa and Google Nest ranges) has meant manufacturers have mainly focused on new features and selling as many new devices as possible.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">As a result of this, and the fact these devices tend to work better with the more data they collect, there is little focus on security and privacy.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">There is also little thought about security and privacy from users of smart homes. People often only care about new and exciting features, security and privacy features are often forgotten about entirely.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">A study was completed in 2023 by N.M.A. Hujits (et al.) where users' reactions to a cyber-attack on a smart home were recorded. The study found that awareness and concern of cyber-security in smart homes was low, and were not aware their data is stored in the cloud (which is effectively someone else's computer, and most cloud services store data in plain text, so anyone with access can view it).</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">In addition, many people in this study believe there is no risk at all in using smart home devices, which is simply not true.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">The study also found that people do not understand how smart home devices work behind the scenes, which means people do not understand why there are security and privacy risks.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">If you do not secure your smart home and a hacker compromises your smart device, YOUR SENSITIVE INFO COULD BE AT RISK. Criminals could sell your personal details, particularly your email address and passwords. Your accounts could then be accessed, and plenty of damage can be done. Being aware of security and privacy is especially important in the very internet reliant world that we live in.</p>
        <div class="gap"></div>
        <p class="text-left custom-paragraph">Smart Home devices can often be used by hackers as a way of entering your network (you may refer to it as your home wifi). This means the hacker will exploit potential security flaws in your smart home device, and then can attempt to attack your other devices. </p>
